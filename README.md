# rlox

This repository is an attempt to follow the ["Crafting Interpreters" book by Robert Nystrom](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)
and adapt both the Java (jlox) and C (clox) Lox interpreters to the Rust programming language. 

Originally, this project is only being built for the sole purpose of learning Rust and interpreters/compilers theory and practice. Therefore, no major changes are being done to the interpreter's structure, architecture and design.
